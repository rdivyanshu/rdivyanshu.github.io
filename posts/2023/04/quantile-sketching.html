<h1 class="title">A bit on Quantile Sketching</h1>
</header>
<p>As part of production monitoring it is standard practice to measure
<code>p95</code>, <code>p99</code> latencies. We also want to query
these metrics over dynamic time range. What is <code>p99</code> latency
over last <code>3</code> hours? What is <code>p99</code> latency over
last <code>5</code> minutes?</p>
<p>One option is calculate quantiles at client using <a
href="https://github.com/statsite/statsite">statsite</a> which will
calculate configured quantiles for timer metrics over flush interval and
then send data to monitoring servers for query. Quantiles statsite
calculates is approximate to reduce memory footprint of statsite
library. There are other issues with this approach besides quantiles
being approximate.</p>
<ul>
<li>If configured quantiles are <code>p95</code> and <code>p99</code>,
you can’t query <code>p99.9</code>. When using this approach you need to
know before hand what quantiles you care about.</li>
<li>It is not possible to find quantile over dynamic time range. Only
quantile over flush interval will right (within error bounds according
to approximation algorithm).</li>
<li>It is not possible to find <code>p99</code> latency, assuming
<code>p99</code> is configured quantile, across all instances of
service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reason for last two is there is no meaningful way to combine
individual quantiles.</p>
<p>In following discussions I will assuming that quantiles are
calculated on servers of monitoring stack. To accurately calculate
quantities we can send all latencies data to server from application
instances making heavy demand on storage and computation (at query time)
on monitoring systems. This is unacceptable. To avoid it modern
monitoring systems use quantile sketches which can calculate quantiles
values within some error bounds by storing summary of data.</p>
<p>Idea behind quantile sketching is clients will send out latency
summary bucketed into bins with each bin measuring how many times
latency falls within bounds of bucket. Using above data it is possible
to find out in which bucket queried quantile will fall. After which
linear interpolation can give point estimate of quantile.</p>
<p>Let’s go through steps to find <code>p95</code> from below
histogram</p>
<p><img src="../../../img/hist.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Our dataset contains <code>330</code> entries. If we sort our
dataset the value at index <code>floor(q*(n-1))+1</code> is (Lower)
q-quantile. Plugging values in formula we get <code>p95</code> should be
<code>313</code>th entry.</li>
<li><code>313</code>th entry lies in bucket
<code>70</code>-<code>80</code>. Assuming uniform distribution,
<code>313</code>th entry should be <code>70+(313-240)*(10/80)</code>
which amounts to <code>79.12</code>, our <code>p95</code> estimate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mergeability">Mergeability</h3>
<p>Querying over dynamic time range and over multiple instances requires
mergeability - given multiple quantile sketches it should be possible to
combine them to get overall quantiles. Using histograms mergeability
requires bin boundaries are same so we can add corresponding bin
counters to get combined quantile sketch.</p>
<h3 id="error-bounds">Error Bounds</h3>
<p>In example above, point estimate of <code>p95</code> is
<code>79.12</code>. Since it is estimate, it is better to get error
bounds. As we don’t have any insight into bins, it is possible that true
<code>p95</code> lies anywhere between <code>70</code> (exclusive) and
<code>80</code>. Relative error can be <code>13%</code> when true
<code>p95</code> is near <code>70</code> and <code>1%</code> when it is
<code>80</code>. Relative error of <code>p95</code> is bounded above by
<code>13%</code>. Following table shows what is maximum relative error
(in percentage) across quantiles which fall within that bucket. As you
can see maximum relative error varies across buckets. It is possible to
design buckets such that maximum relative error is fixed. If buckets are
log-based with <code>1.125</code> multiplier
(<code>(1,1.125], (1.125,(1.125)^2] ...</code>) then maximum relative
error will be <code>12.5%</code> across buckets.</p>

<p>Prometheus’s default bucket configuration can be seen <a
href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/v0.16.0/prometheus_client/metrics.py#L544">here</a>.
Notice that last bucket upper bound is <code>Inf</code>. If quantile
falls into last bucket, it will return 10.0 as quantile estimate, lower
bound of last bucket. It is not possible to linear interpolate in last
bucket as upper bound is <code>Inf</code>. As a result it is hard to
find maximum relative error for last bucket. VictoriaMetrics divides
<code>[10^(-9),10^18]</code> range into log based buckets with
<code>10^(1/18)</code> multiplier <a
href="https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics/blob/v1.23.1/histogram.go#L11">[github]</a>.
This gives ability to capture wide range of observation (nanoseconds in
time scale, million of terabytes in storage scale) with
<code>13.6%</code> worst case relative estimate of quantile.
HdrHistogram, DDSketch and Circllhist are other quantile sketches which
are used in industry.</p>
